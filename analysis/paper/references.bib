              specialized differentiated cell populations of the mucociliated
              airway epithelium during physiological turnover and repair.
              Cultured primary BC divide a limited number of times before
              entering a state of replicative senescence, preventing the
              establishment of long-term replicating cultures of airway BC that
              maintain their original phenotype. METHODS: To generate an
              immortalized human airway BC cell line, primary human airway BC
              obtained by brushing the airway epithelium of healthy nonsmokers
              were infected with a retrovirus expressing human telomerase
              (hTERT). The resulting immortalized cell line was then
              characterized under non-differentiating and differentiating
              air-liquid interface (ALI) culture conditions using ELISA, TaqMan
              quantitative PCR, Western analysis, and immunofluorescent and
              immunohistochemical staining analysis for cell type specific
              markers. In addition, the ability of the cell line to respond to
              environmental stimuli under differentiating ALI culture was
              assessed. RESULTS: We successfully generated an immortalized
              human airway BC cell line termed BCi-NS1 via expression of hTERT.
              A single cell derived clone from the parental BCi-NS1 cells,
              BCi-NS1.1, retains characteristics of the original primary cells
              for over 40 passages and demonstrates a multipotent
              differentiation capacity into secretory (MUC5AC, MUC5B), goblet
              (TFF3), Clara (CC10) and ciliated (DNAI1, FOXJ1) cells on ALI

              resulting in alteration of the normal differentiation process.
              CONCLUSION: Development of immortalized human airway BC that
              retain multipotent differentiation capacity over long-term
              culture should be useful in understanding the biology of BC, the

              analysis. As an unsupervised exploratory procedure its results
              can help researchers to gain insights and formulate new
              hypothesis about biological data from microarrays. Given
              different settings of microarray experiments, clustering proves
              itself as a versatile exploratory tool. It can help to unveil new
              cancer subtypes or to identify groups of genes that respond
              similarly to a specific experimental condition. In order to
              obtain useful clustering results, however, different parameters
              of the clustering procedure must be properly tuned. Besides the
              selection of the clustering method itself, determining which
              distance is going to be employed between data objects is probably
              one of the most difficult decisions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We
              analyze how different distances and clustering methods interact
              regarding their ability to cluster gene expression, i.e.,
              microarray data. We study 15 distances along with four common
              clustering methods from the literature on a total of 52 gene
              expression microarray datasets. Distances are evaluated on a
              number of different scenarios including clustering of cancer
              tissues and genes from short time-series expression data, the two
              main clustering applications in gene expression. Our results
              support that the selection of an appropriate distance depends on
              the scenario in hand. Moreover, in each scenario, given the very
              same clustering method, significant differences in quality may
              arise from the selection of distinct distance measures. In fact,
              the selection of an appropriate distance measure can make the
              difference between meaningful and poor clustering outcomes, even
              for a suitable clustering method.",

              to better understand the contribution of basal cell hyperplasia
              and associated mucosecretory dysfunction to the development of
              idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).Objectives: We sought to
              decipher the transcriptome of freshly isolated epithelial cells
              from normal and IPF lungs to discern disease-dependent changes
              within basal stem cells.Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing was
              used to map epithelial cell types of the normal and IPF human
              airways. Organoid and air-liquid interface cultures were used to
              investigate functional properties of basal cell
              subtypes.Measurements and Main Results: We found that basal cells
              included multipotent and secretory primed subsets in control
              adult lung tissue. Secretory primed basal cells include an
              overlapping molecular signature with basal cells obtained from
              the distal lung tissue of IPF lungs. We confirmed that NOTCH2
              maintains undifferentiated basal cells and restricts
              basal-to-ciliated differentiation, and we present evidence that
              NOTCH3 functions to restrain secretory
              differentiation.Conclusions: Basal cells are dynamically
              regulated in disease and are specifically biased toward the
              expansion of the secretory primed basal cell subset in IPF.

              (HERVs) comprise about 8\% of the genome, the vast majority of
              which are truncated and/or highly mutated and no longer encode
              functional genes. The most recently active retroviruses that
              integrated into the human germ line are members of the
              Betaretrovirus-like HERV-K (HML-2) group, many of which contain
              intact open reading frames (ORFs) in some or all genes, sometimes
              encoding functional proteins that are expressed in various
              tissues. Interestingly, this expression is upregulated in many
              tumors ranging from breast and ovarian tissues to lymphomas and
              melanomas, as well as schizophrenia, rheumatoid arthritis, and
              other disorders. RESULTS: No study to date has characterized all
              HML-2 elements in the genome, an essential step towards
              determining a possible functional role of HML-2 expression in

              with norepinephrine (NE) to produce 6-nitro-norepinephrine
              (6-NO2-NE), a compound that enhances NE release in the brain.
              Previous studies suggest that 6-NO2-NE is formed in the spinal
              cord and stimulates spinal NE release to produce analgesia. The
              purpose of the current studies was to examine the mechanisms by
              which 6-NO2-NE stimulates NE release in the spinal cord. Crude
              synaptosomes were prepared from spinal cords of male
              Sprague-Dawley rats and loaded with [3H]NE. Incubation of
              synaptosomes with 6-NO2-NE resulted in a release of NE, with a
              threshold of 1 $\mu$M 6-NO2-NE and a maximum effect of 30\%
              fractional release. NE transporter inhibitors desipramine and
              nomifensine blocked NE release from 6-NO2-NE, and desipramine
              exhibited an IC50 of 9.6 $\mu$M. NE release from 6-NO2-NE was
              dependent on external Na+, but not Ca2+ or the activity of
              guanylate cyclase. 6-NO2-NE also blocked uptake of [3H]NE into
              synaptosomes, with an IC50 of 8.3 $\mu$M. These data are
              consistent with a direct action of 6-NO2-NE on noradrenergic
              terminals in the spinal cord to release NE. This action is
              independent of guanylate cyclase activation, and most likely

              tools to explore cells, however analysis is typically
              gene-centric and TE expression has not been addressed. Here, we
              develop a single-cell TE processing pipeline, scTE, and report
              the expression of TEs in single cells in a range of biological
              contexts. Specific TE types are expressed in subpopulations of
              embryonic stem cells and are dynamically regulated during
              pluripotency reprogramming, differentiation, and embryogenesis.
              Unexpectedly, TEs are expressed in somatic cells, including human
              disease-specific TEs that are undetectable in bulk analyses.
              Finally, we apply scTE to single-cell ATAC-seq data, and
              demonstrate that scTE can discriminate cell type using chromatin
              accessibly of TEs alone. Overall, our results classify the

              In chronic airway diseases, defective repair leads to tissue
              remodeling. Delineating key drivers of differentiation dynamics
              can help understand how normal or pathological regeneration

              we have unraveled trajectories from basal to luminal cells,

              (1) a precursor subgroup of multiciliated cells, which we have
              entitled deuterosomal cells, is defined by specific markers, such
              as DEUP1, FOXN4, YPEL1, HES6 and CDC20B; (2) goblet cells can be

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful
              tool for studying complex biological systems, such as tumor
              heterogeneity and tissue microenvironments. However, the sources
              of technical and biological variation in primary solid tumor
              tissues and patient-derived mouse xenografts for scRNA-seq are
              not well understood. RESULTS: We use low temperature (6 °C)
              protease and collagenase (37 °C) to identify the transcriptional
              signatures associated with tissue dissociation across a diverse
              scRNA-seq dataset comprising 155,165 cells from patient cancer
              tissues, patient-derived breast cancer xenografts, and cancer
              cell lines. We observe substantial variation in standard quality
              control metrics of cell viability across conditions and tissues.
              From the contrast between tissue protease dissociation at 37 °C
              or 6 °C, we observe that collagenase digestion results in a
              stress response. We derive a core gene set of 512 heat shock and
              stress response genes, including FOS and JUN, induced by
              collagenase (37 °C), which are minimized by dissociation with a
              cold active protease (6 °C). While induction of these genes was
              highly conserved across all cell types, cell type-specific
              responses to collagenase digestion were observed in patient
              tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The method and conditions of tumor
              dissociation influence cell yield and transcriptome state and are
              both tissue- and cell-type dependent. Interpretation of stress
              pathway expression differences in cancer single-cell studies,
              including components of surface immune recognition such as MHC
              class I, may be especially confounded. We define a core set of
              512 genes that can assist with the identification of such effects
              in dissociated scRNA-seq experiments.",
